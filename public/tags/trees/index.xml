      <description>I think that I shall never see
A poem lovely as a tree.
A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
Against the earthâ€™s sweet flowing breast;
A tree that looks at God all day,
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
A tree that may in Summer wear
A nest of robins in her hair;
Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
Who intimately lives with rain.
Poems are made by fools like me,</description>
