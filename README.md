# hugo-bulma
If all goes well, this repo will ultimately be a bilingual static site theme based on hugo, bulma and bulmaswatch.

The idea is 
1. to start with a clean-slate Setup, following Follow ZWBetz' [Quick Start Guide](https://zwbetz.com/make-a-hugo-blog-from-scratch/):
2. then adopt BEB's [Hugo Bulma Hero](https://github.com/bep/hugo-bulma-hero) Theme in order to have a simple landingpage with sections and dynamically generated links to blogposts.
3. to try [Bulmaswatch](https://jenil.github.io/bulmaswatch/) as a simple, beautiful CSS theme.
4. and ultimately, to separate the test content of this hugo site out into a dedicated content repo, so that this repo becomes a proper hugo theme.

Our rationale at all this is to leverage the bright, rigorous and super concise philosophy of [hugo](https://gohugo.io), [bulma](https://bulma.io/) and [bulmaswatch](https://jenil.github.io/bulmaswatch/help/).

Although the combinations of these three platforms seems extremely promising, apparently there are not many working implementations. So we try it on our own.
